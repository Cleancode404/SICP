;exercise 1.13

;this is a math proof problem and this cannot type math equation
;so cant do it here...

;approach
;Fib(n) is given

;Find out Fib(n + 1) and Fib(n + 2), plug in theta is (1 - sqrt5)/2

;since Fib(n + 2) = Fib(n + 1) + Fib(n)

;after subsitution you see Fib(n) given is correct

;therefore Fib(n) is the closest integer to theta^n/sqrt(5)
